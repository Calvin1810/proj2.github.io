    <h4><center>Univariate and bivariate data analysis on national botulism rates with regards to time and region per capita.</center></h4>
    <p>Botulism is an illness caused by the toxins produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum--which is one of the most potent toxins to humans.
      There are three main categories of botulism: foodborne, infant, and wound. Foodborne botulism occurs after ingesting the bacteria--which commonly occurs following improper
      preparation or storage of canned goods. Infant botulism occurs following ingestion of the bacteria, but is differentiated by the infant immune system. Wound botulism
      occurs when the bacteria spores germinate within wounds and is most commonly seen in people who use illicit drugs. <b> I hypothesize that botulism cases will decrease
      over time due to food packaging and storage improvements and that regions in the West would have higher rates of botulism.
      </b>
    </p>
    <p>We will be analyzing the evolution of national botulism rates. </a>
    The data driving this graph is sourced from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href=https://www.cdc.gov/index.htm>(CDC)</a> data centers on Foodborne, Waterborne, and Related Diseases under <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/chess>Botulism</a>.
    The graph below highlights the fluctuations of botulism rates throughout the 20th and 21st century.
